The goal of d3tm is to create a zoomable treemap capable of handling unbalanced hierachical data.

## Installation (TODO)

You can install the released version of d3tm from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("d3tm")
```

## Example  (TODO)

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(d3tm)
## basic example code
```

## Plan

1. Get zoomable treemap code working.
2. Add shiny interactivity.
3. Build demonstration apps.
4. Deploy at work.
5. Disemminate code to interested persons.
